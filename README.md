# Visualized Countries

Originally, the project used an API to filter countries by name, size (smaller than Lithuania), and region (Oceania). Over time, I improved it by adding pagination, expanding the regions, and adding a reset filter. I also focused on accessibility to enhance the user experience.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Building the Visualized Countries app involved a few key challenges:

- **Efficient Filtering & Pagination**: Allowing users to filter countries by name, region, and size while keeping the app fast and responsive.
- **Easy Navigation & Reset**: Making it simple for users to browse results and reset filters when needed.

- **Accessibility & Usability**: Ensuring the app is easy to use for everyone, with a focus on accessibility.
